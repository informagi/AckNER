# AckNER

Repository with code for the paper _"This research is funded by..." Named Entity Recognition of financial information in research papers_.

This package allows to extract funding information (including funding organisations's names, contracts and grants) from `.pdf` files.

The file `acknow_mod.py` contains the following 5 functions:

- The first function extracts the page containing acknowledgements/funding section
- The second function extracts the sentences that contain the funding information
- the third function extracts the names of the funding organisations
- the fourth function extracts contract numbers, grant numbers and also abbreviations
- the fifth function writes the result into a csv file

**Docker:**

In order to run the package on docker you need to

1. build a docker image: `docker build -t <image_name>`
1. run the following command on your data: `docker run -v <path_to_data_folder>:/data/articles -v <path_to_output_folder>:/data/output an4`

The output folder is the folder where you want to store a `.csv` file. Note that both paths should be absolute and the data should only be in `.pdf` format. 

**Results of the study:**

The repository also contains the results of the comparison of our program's output to the golden standard file (`synt_R.csv`). The results are stored against each other and the type of the result and the outcome is shown (`tp` - true positives, `fp` - false positives, `fn` - false negatives).
